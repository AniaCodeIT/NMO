## Simulated Annealing for Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem
This project was created as part of the university course "Non-Classical Optimization Methods". The goal of the project was to apply the Simulated Annealing algorithm to solve the Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem, a key problem in combinatorial optimization.
